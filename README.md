# Leap_Motion_Piano-simple
This is a virtual piano with Processing and Leap Motion. 
This code is super basic easy to understand, since I just learned how to code with Processing at that time. 
Ther are a lot of things can be added and improved.
All the thresholds in the code need to be tuned. 
To tun this code, you need to install 2 libraries: Minim and Leap-motion-processing
